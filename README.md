# Technologies/Skills Used

* Java
* Eclipse
* GitHub
* Enumerated Types
* Multiple Methods
* Multiple classes
* Abstraction

# Lessons Learned

* Continued improvement with utilizing multiple methods
* (Personal Note) jumps into problems instead of thinking problem through, therefore, creating more problems that could have been solved through proper planning
* Need improvement in understanding Abstract classes and Lists
* Improved in simplifying code but need to get better at recognizing when to call which classes where
* Need to improve on naming variables. Plenty of confusion on which was called and where to
* OVERALL: A lot of assistance was needed. Need to understand programming logic and work on smaller projects to be able to recognize and understand coding
